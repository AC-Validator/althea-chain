# Althea Testnet 1

Althea Testnet #1 mainly focuses around the Gravity bridge integration. Our goal is to run this testnet right up until the launch of the Althea chain

- Althea chain parameter selection
- Gravity bridge slashing
- Gravity bridge Orchestrator stability
- IBC testing with B-Harvest and Agoric

If you would like to join this testnet connect with us on the [Althea Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/vw8twzR) where you can request testnet tokens to stake or just play around with.
